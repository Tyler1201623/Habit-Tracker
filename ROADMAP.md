Got it! Here's a detailed roadmap for the Habit Tracker project without code, outlining every feature, functionality, and implementation plan:

Habit Tracker Roadmap
1. Project Objective
Build a responsive and user-friendly habit tracker that:

Helps users visualize their habit progress over the current month.
Tracks streaks (current and longest).
Saves data locally for offline use.
Works seamlessly on all devices with a light/dark theme toggle.
2. Features and Functionalities
1. Add and Manage Habits
Users can add new habits with names (e.g., "Drink Water", "Exercise").
Display a card for each habit with a title, calendar view, progress bar, and streak information.
Allow habits to be deleted individually.
2. Monthly Calendar Visualization
Each habit will display a 30-day calendar for the current month.
Users can click on a specific day to toggle habit completion (completed or not completed).
Days that are completed will be highlighted visually.
3. Progress Bar
Each habit card will have a progress bar under the calendar.
The progress bar dynamically updates to show the percentage of completed days out of the total days in the current month.
4. Streak Tracking
Track:
Current Streak: Number of consecutive days the habit has been completed.
Longest Streak: The highest number of consecutive days the habit has been completed since it was added.
Display streak data prominently on each habit card.
5. LocalStorage Integration
Save habit data (name, daily progress, streaks) to localStorage.
Retrieve and display saved data when the app is reloaded.
Automatically reset streaks if a new month starts.
6. Dark/Light Mode
Allow users to toggle between light and dark themes.
Save the user’s theme preference in localStorage.
7. Responsive Design
Ensure the app works on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Use a flexible layout that adjusts habit cards and the calendar grid for smaller screens.
3. User Flow
On First Load:

The app displays a form to add new habits.
If habits are already stored in localStorage, they are loaded and displayed.
Adding a Habit:

The user types a habit name into the input field and submits the form.
A new habit card is created with a calendar, progress bar, and streak data.
Toggling a Day’s Completion:

The user clicks on a day in the calendar to mark it as completed or incomplete.
The calendar highlights completed days.
The progress bar and streak data update immediately.
Viewing Progress:

The user can see their progress as a percentage in the progress bar.
Current streak and longest streak are displayed on the habit card.
Theme Toggle:

The user can switch between dark and light themes using a toggle button.
The chosen theme persists across sessions.
Deleting a Habit:

A delete button on each habit card allows the user to remove the habit.
The habit and its data are removed from localStorage.
4. Design Plan
Layout
Header:
App title on the left.
Dark/Light mode toggle on the right.
Main Content:
A form at the top for adding habits.
A grid of habit cards below the form, dynamically updated as habits are added or removed.
Habit Card
Each card will include:

Habit Name: Displayed at the top of the card.
Calendar: A 30-day grid where completed days are highlighted.
Progress Bar: A horizontal bar showing the percentage of days completed.
Streak Info: Text displaying the current and longest streaks.
Styling
Light Theme:
White backgrounds with green and gray accents.
Black text for better readability.
Dark Theme:
Dark gray backgrounds with orange and white accents.
White text for contrast.
Responsiveness:
Cards will stack vertically on smaller screens, while calendars and buttons scale appropriately.
5. Technical Specifications
Front-End Technologies
HTML: To structure the layout of the habit tracker.
CSS: For styling, responsiveness, and theming (light/dark modes).
JavaScript: To handle:
Dynamic updates (habit management, calendar interaction).
Data persistence with localStorage.
Progress calculations and streak tracking.
Key JavaScript Features
Event Handling:
Add, delete, and interact with habits.
Toggle completion on calendar days.
Dynamic DOM Manipulation:
Generate habit cards and calendar grids dynamically.
Update streaks and progress bars in real time.
LocalStorage Integration:
Save habits and progress.
Retrieve data on page load.
Handle edge cases (e.g., resetting streaks on a new month).
Performance Optimization
Minimize reflows and repaints by batching DOM updates.
Use a single re-render function for habit cards.
6. Stretch Goals
Monthly Reset:

Automatically reset the calendar and progress at the start of each new month.
Archive past data for reference.
Customizable Colors:

Allow users to choose highlight colors for completed days.
Offer premium themes for monetization.
Habit Analytics:

Provide a summary for each habit (e.g., "Completed 20/30 days this month").
Show weekly trends (e.g., "Most active on Mondays").
Cross-Browser Testing:

Ensure compatibility with all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).
